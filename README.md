# C++-Image-Processing-Program-using-Sobel-Operator

This C++ program implements the Sobel Operator, a popular edge detection algorithm used in image processing and computer vision. The program reads an input image, applies the Sobel Operator to calculate the image gradients, and outputs the resulting edge-detected image.


How to run the program?

1.You should prepare a test file for processing in jpg format. 
2.Determine the program's operating mode by choosing options in the menu. 
3.Perform a header read from the file. Select a filter from the file. 
4.Use the Sobel operator and save the image to a file in bmp format.

Note:
The input image should be of a common format such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP.

The output image will be saved in the same format as the input image.
